# 🌤️ Bukcast: A System Integration Project of Real-Time Weather Monitoring in Bukidnon

## 🧭 Project Overview  
**Bukcast** is a community-centered web application that delivers accurate and localized weather information for the Province of Bukidnon.  
Developed with a user-first mindset, it integrates reliable global weather APIs with an intuitive, minimalist interface—bridging technology, usability, and environmental awareness.  
This project serves both as an academic prototype and a potential grassroots startup tool that empowers farmers, students, and local residents through accessible climate insights.

## 🎯 Purpose & Motivation  
Weather awareness in Bukidnon remains fragmented, with most forecasts focused on national data that miss local variations.  
**Bukcast** addresses this gap by localizing environmental information, offering easy access to relevant weather insights through a clean, responsive, and mobile-friendly design.  
It reflects the principle of *“Tech that serves the community,”* combining practicality with data-driven precision.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy (HCI & UX)  
The system is designed under **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** principles—prioritizing clarity, consistency, and accessibility.  
- Minimalist design inspired by Bukidnon’s earthy landscapes 🌾  
- Neutral and calming color palette for comfortable daily use  
- Fully responsive layout using TailwindCSS  
- Designed for rural bandwidth conditions and community inclusivity  

User experience decisions were informed by observation and empathy, applying the iterative design cycle:  
**Empathize → Define → Design → Prototype → Test**

## 🧠 Technical Foundations (APIs & System Integration)  
Bukcast operates on a **data-driven architecture** that synchronizes multiple APIs to ensure both accuracy and reliability.  

**🔹 OpenWeatherMap API**  
> Provides real-time and 7-day weather forecasts, including temperature, humidity, wind, and storm probability.

**🔹 Thunderforest Maps API**  
> Supplies map tiles and thematic layers based on OpenStreetMap data, visualizing weather conditions over Bukidnon’s terrain.

**🔹 MapTiler API**  
> Enhances geospatial rendering and performance, ensuring fast map loading and dynamic user navigation.

Together, these APIs enable Bukcast to deliver a cohesive, accurate, and visually engaging weather experience for both academic use and real-world application.
